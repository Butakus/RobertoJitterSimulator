# RobertoJitterSimulator
Master's application to teleoperate Roberto (https://github.com/Butakus/RobertoTeleop). Roberto is a rover I've been developping since a few years ago until forever. It is an experimental platform to test sensors, robotic parts and other toys.

This is a simulator to inject delay+jitter into the packets to emulate a real connection through Internet.

The controller is a Wii's Nunchuck (https://github.com/Butakus/NunchuckController).
